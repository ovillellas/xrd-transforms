"""Test suite for hexrd.transforms"""

# Use a file for each api function to test named test_<function>.py
#
# Configure the all_impls decorator (based on pytest.mark.parametrize)
#
# Each test to be applied to all implementations should be preceded by an
# @all_impls decorator. The test function will take two arguments, the first one
# is the implementation to test, the second will be a "module" name used to
# better identify the function implementation.
#
# It should be possible to test different implementations in the same module
# that differ in name, and distinguish between implementation from different
# modules that use the same name by appropriate tagging with a module name.
